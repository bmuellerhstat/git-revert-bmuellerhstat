`restaurant.html`

Imagine if we were working on a website for a restaurant, and we...
* Add the bare minimum of the whole website with a blue color scheme
  * _This part is already done_
* Change the color scheme from blues to greens (CSS _and_ text).
  * **Do this, then add+commit**
* Delete all images because they're copyrighted
  * **Do this, then add+commit**

What if the restaurant owner changes their mind, and wants to turn greens back to blues?

### Your Task: use `git revert`

**Undo your commit that changed blues to greens.**

_This will change them back to blues._

_But notice that it preserved our deletion of copyrighted images!_

**Make sure you push your changes to Github!**
